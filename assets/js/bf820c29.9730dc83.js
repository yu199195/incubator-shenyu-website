These privileges are offered on the understanding that you'll use them reasonably and with common sense. We like to work on trust\nrather than unnecessary constraints.\nBeing a committer enables you to more easily make changes without needing to go through the patch submission process.\nBeing a committer does not require you to participate any more than you already do. It does tend to make one even more committed.  You will probably find that you spend more time here.\nOf course, you can decline and instead remain as a contributor, participating as you do now.\nA. This personal invitation is a chance for you to accept or decline in private.  Either way, please let us know in reply to the private@shenyu.apache.org \naddress only.\nB. If you accept, the next step is to register an iCLA:\n    1. Details of the iCLA and the forms are found through this link: http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas\n\n    2. Instructions for its completion and return to the Secretary of the ASF are found at http://www.apache.org/licenses/#submitting\n\n    3. When you transmit the completed iCLA, request to notify the Apache shenyu and choose a unique Apache id. Look to see if your preferred id is already taken at http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html        \nThis will allow the Secretary to notify the PMC when your iCLA has been recorded.\nWhen recording of your iCLA is noticed, you will receive a follow-up message with the next steps for establishing you as a committer.\n\nBest wishes,\n(PPMC)\n\n")),(0,a.kt)("p",null,(0,a.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"5.

If you also make contributions done in work time or using work resources then see the Corporate CLA. Ask us if you have any issues. \nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas\n\nYou need to choose a preferred ASF user name and alternatives. In order to ensure it is available you can view a list of taken ids at\nhttp://people.apache.org/committer-index.html\nPlease notify us when you have submitted the CLA and by what means you did so. This will enable us to monitor its progress.\n\nWe will arrange for your Apache user account when the CLA has been recorded.\n\nAfter that is done, please make follow-up replies to the shenyu-dev list.
