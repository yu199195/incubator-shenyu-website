When ShenYu graduates from the Incubator to a top-level\nproject, the project PMC is usually formed from the membership of the PPMC.\nNote that while participation in the PMC after graduation is not\nguaranteed, simply continuing your constructive and active participation\nis usually sufficient.\n\nAs a PPMC member, and later as a PMC member, you are responsible for\ncontinuing the general project, code, and community oversight that you\nhave exhibited so far.  The votes of the PPMC are not legally binding;\nvotes of the Incubator PMC are.  However, many of the PPMC members\nare also Incubator PMC members, so they implicitly cast binding votes\nwhen we vote on PPMC issues.  While this is an important legal\ndistinction, it shouldn't enter your thinking when working on the PPMC -\nmembers should treat every decision as if it were legally binding for the ASF.  \nAlso, in day-to-day activities, the Incubator PMC member vs PPMC member\ndistinction should be invisible -- we are peers.\n\nAll PPMC members are subscribed to the project's private mail list, which \nis used to discuss issues unsuitable for an open, public forum, such as\npeople issues (e.g. new committers, problematic community members, etc.),\nsecurity issues, and the like.  It can't be emphasized enough that\ncare should be taken to minimize the use of the private list, discussing\neverything possible on the appropriate public list.\n\nThe private PPMC list is *private* - it is strictly for the use of the\nPPMC. Messages are not to be forwarded to anyone else without the express\npermission of the PPMC. Also note that any Member of the Foundation has\nthe right to review and participate in any PPMC or PMC list, as a PMC \nand PPMC are acting on behalf of the Membership.\n\nFinally, the PPMC (and assuming graduation, the PMC) is not meant to create \na hierarchy within the committership or the community.  In fact, a goal is to\nadd all committers over time to the PPMC/PMC, as our belief is that those who\ndo the work should get a binding vote.  Therefore, in our day-to-day\ninteractions with the rest of the community, we continue to interact as\npeers, where every reasonable opinion is considered, and all community\nmembers are invited to participate in our public voting.  If there ever\nis a situation where the PMC/PPMC's view differs significantly from that \nof the rest of the community, this is a symptom of a problem that needs to\nbe addressed.\n\nWith the expectation of your acceptance, welcome!\n\nThe Apache ShenYu PPMC\n\n")),(0,i.kt)("p",null,(0,i.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"8.
